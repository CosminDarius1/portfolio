    <p>Hi, I'm Cosmin, a passionate full-stack developer eager to innovate and create.My journey into coding started with a desire to switch careers, leading me to join the  award-winning Full Stack Track Course at iO Academy.In there I have enforced my skills on languages like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT but also had the opportunity to learn the PHP language,also I have had the chance to work with frameworks like REACT and Slim.I enjoyed working in collaborative team environments,following Agile methodologies and delivering successful projects.To get a better glimpse to what I've done, please explore my projects below

        <p>Here are some of my projects

        <h3>Email Client</h3>

            <p>Email client app is a project which emulates a real email client.In this project the user should be able
                to compose new emails,send and receive emails from an API , validation rules were implemented as well,
                and trying to send emails to an invalid adddress would not be possible. During this project I used React
                and together with my team we build an application based on a supplied design and utilising an existing
                API. The application will implement features such as pagination, search and filters, all with a crisp
                responsive front-end based on a provided design.

            <p>Project Management APP is a Trello-like kind of app, where the user is Project Manager , and it would be
                able to see all the projects, which people were assigned to each project,and also the tasks that people
                took during their projects.During this project I used PHP OOP and together with my team we managed to
                build a well architected API,which was providing the right data from the database to the Front End and
                also showcasing the right error codes and messages when something was wrong.

                <p>
                    During this project I tested my JavaScript skills and along with my teammates we created Caterpillar
                    Countdown which is a JavaScript based computer game where the user can test its mental agility.The
                    game consists of rounds and within each round the user will see 3 to 5
                    different numbers between 0-100.The user needs to click on the numbers in ascending order to allow
                    to
                    progress to the next round. Each round that is completed will add 1 point to the score and a timer
                    set for 30 seconds will start when the user will click on play.
