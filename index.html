    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Cosmin , aspiring software developer. My coding journey started not long ago, when I decided to change career and try learning how to code.During this time I have learned and completed few projects using HTML, CSS and JavaScript , but I knew that this will not be enough to help me to enter into the IT industry. I have decided to switch gears and joined iO academy's Full Stack Track Course. iO academy is an Award-winning Coding Bootcamp and I knew that this can be the  place where I'll be able to work and learn from people who are actual developers and help me to achieve my dream to find a job in IT industry.During my time at iO academy, I have learned even better how to work with HTML,CSS,JavaScript but also PHP, I have learned about Agile way of working and received an Agile Professional Certification as well.I have completed several projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP both on my own but also in a team and presented them in our Sprint Reviews. I was introduced to REACT library and Slim framework and finished bigger projects than before.My portfolio with my few of my projects are down below the page. Thank you!

        <p>Here are some of my projects<p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h3>Email client</h3>
        <div class="card-img-text">
            <img src="email.png" onclick="openModal('email.png')" class="project-image" alt="Email Client Project">
            <p>Email client app is a project which emulates a real email client.In this project the user should be able to compose new emails,send and receive emails from an API , validation rules were implemented as well, and trying to send  emails to an invalid adddress would not be possible. During this project I used React and together with my team we build an application based on a supplied design and utilising an existing API. The application will implement features such as pagination, search and filters, all with a crisp responsive front-end based on a provided design.

        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <div class="card-img-text">
            <div class="project-imgs">
                <img src="project.png">
                <img src="project2.png">
            </div>
            <p>Project Management APP is a Trello-like kind of app, where the user is Project Manager , and  it  would be able to see all the projects, which people were assigned to each project,and also the tasks that people took during their projects.During this project I used PHP OOP and together with my team we managed to build a well architected API,which was providing the right data from the database to the Front End and also showcasing the right error codes and messages when something was wrong.

            <h3>Caterpillar Countdown</h3>
            <div class="card-img-text">
                <div class="project-imgs">
                    <img src="caterpillar.png">
                    <img src="caterpillar2.png">
                </div>
                    <p>
                    During this project I tested my JavaScript skills and along with my teammates we created Caterpillar Countdown which  is a JavaScript based computer game where the user can test its mental agility.The game consists of rounds and within each round the user will see 3 to 5
                    different numbers between 0-100.The user needs to click on the numbers in ascending order to allow  to
                    progress to the next round. Each round that is completed will add 1 point to the score and a timer set for 30 seconds will start when the user will click on play.
